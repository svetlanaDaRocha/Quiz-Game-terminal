### Project: Terminal-Based Quiz Game in JavaScript

#### Objective

Your goal is to create a text-based quiz game that runs in the terminal. The game should offer a variety of trivia questions across different categories and difficulty levels.

#### Features and Requirements

1. **Categories**: Your quiz game should have at least three different categories. For example, you might choose categories like "Science," "History," and "Entertainment."
2. **Difficulty Levels**: Each category should offer questions at multiple difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
3. **Question Pool**: Preload the game with a minimum of 5 questions per category per difficulty level. The questions can be multiple-choice or true/false.
4. **User Interaction**: Use a package like `prompt-sync` to interact with the user. Prompt the user to choose a category and difficulty level before starting the quiz.
5. **Question Presentation**: Once the user has made their choices, present one question at a time and ask for their answer.
6. **Scoring**: Keep track of the user's score. Award points based on the difficulty level of the questions (e.g., 1 point for Easy, 2 points for Medium, 3 points for Hard).
7. **Feedback**: After each question, inform the user whether they were correct or not and display the correct answer if they were wrong.
8. **Game Progression**: After answering all questions in a round, display the user's total score and offer them the option to play another round or quit the game.
9. **Data Validation**: Implement input validation to handle invalid inputs gracefully. For example, if a user types in an incorrect choice, prompt them to try again.

#### Optional Features

1. **Time Limit**: Add a time limit for each question to increase the challenge.
2. **Leaderboard**: Maintain a leaderboard that tracks the top scores across games.
3. **Randomization**: Randomize the order of questions and answer choices.
4. **Save and Load**: Allow the user to save their progress and resume the game later.

#### Technical Notes

- You're only allowed to use plain JavaScript and the terminal for this project. No external libraries for the game logic, please.
- Use an npm package like `prompt-sync` to gather user input. You'll need to install this package using npm.
